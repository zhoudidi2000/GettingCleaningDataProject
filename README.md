#### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0
##subsetted and reorgnized dataset----data_second :computer:

========================================



1. The cleaned tidy data submitted is named data_second.txt. This data is subsetted from the data.txt, which is created by merging of the training and test sets. 
2. There are 561 measurements in the dataset data.txt. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation(std) is extracted to create data_second.txt. 
3. The activities was labeled with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in data_second.txt, which are "Walking", "Walking_upstairs", "Walking_downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying", respectively. 
4. Discriptive variable names are appropriately labeled according to feature.txt file.
5. Finally, the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was reorgnized to created the data_second.txt file.

For more detailed information about original data, please look at 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.
